About
-----

This is just a sample structure for JavaScript testing with QUnit and Sinon. I find a pain in the ass starting those so I created this project with a basic start up for JavaScript tests.

For more information on those see:

- http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit
- http://sinonjs.org

Project Structure
-----------------

css 
---
Css directory ships QUnit's original css file

lib 
----
Lib directory ships with required javascript files for Qunit and Sinon. jQuery is being loaded using jQuery's CDN.

suite.html
----------

Sample structure of a QUnit html test suite with all required files being loaded.

There are comments to help you place both you production and test scripts.

Additionally to the basic QUnit markup there's also a div#qunit-fixture where you can add any needed markups. This div's content get's cleaned up by QUnit so you don't have to worry about your tests leaving garbage behind.

Sample directory
----------------
This is my sample's sample :) Not a real project but I'll be adding examples on Sinon and QUnit tests. For now there you will find:

- How to stub an ajax call?
- How to mock a jQuery animation?

If you are using these frameworks for testing and would like to help contributing with more examples feel free to do so!

More to Come
------------

Next steps are:

- Setting up JS Coverage for your tests
- Scripts to help add javascript testing to your Continuous Integration. I'm thinking Selenium or other browsing testing tool and well and a simple URL script.
